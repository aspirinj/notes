### Conditional Probability  
This is the idea of conditioning, *taking away the randomness* that we know to have occurred.  
The __Conditional probability__ of an event $A$ given that event $B$ has occurred:  
$$P(A | B) = \frac{P(A  \cap  B)}{P(B)}$$
If $A$ and $B$ are *unrelated*, in other words __Independent__, then:  
$$P(A | B) = \frac{P(A)P(B)}{P(B)} = P(A)$$
*Example:* for die roll, $A = \{1\}$, $B = \{1, 3, 5\}$. Given that we already know the die roll was an odd number, the conditional probability now is $1\over3$, because we have extra information.  
  $$P(A | B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)} = \frac{P(A)}{P(B)} = \frac{1/6}{3/6} = \frac{1}{3}$$  
*Notice:* in this example, $A$ is the subset of $B$.   


### Baye's Rule  
Bayesâ€™ rule allows us to switch the conditioning event, provided with a little bit of extra information.  
$$P(B | A) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(A)} = \frac{P(A | B)P(B)}{P(A | B)P(B)+P(A | B^c)P(B^c)}$$  
where $B^c$ = corresponding probability of event $B$, $P(B^c) = 1 - P(B)$



### Independence
Two events $A$ and $B$ are __Independent__ if the following is true  
$$P(A \cap B) = P(A)P(B)$$  
Or equivalently by using the definition of conditional probability:  
$$P(A | B) = P(A)$$  
*While this definition works for __sets__, remember that __random variables__ are really the things that we are interested in.* Two random variables $X$ and $Y$ are independent, if for any two sets, $A$ and $B$:  
$$P([X \in A]\cap[Y \in B]) = P(X \in A)P(Y \in B)$$  


__Mutually Exclusive__ (__Disjoint__) Events are events that cannot both happen at the same time: if $A$ and $B$ are mutually exclusive. $P(A \cap B)=0$  
  Distinguish between __Disjoint__ and __Independent__ events:  
  * If $A$ and $B$ are independent, then having information on $A$ does not tell us anything about $B$ (and vice versa).
  * If $A$ and $B$ are disjoint, then knowing that $A$ occurs tells us that $B$ cannot occur (and vice versa).
  * *Disjoint (mutually exclusive) events are always dependent* since if one event occurs we know the other one cannot.


### IID Random Variables
Random variables are said to be independent and identically distributed ($iid$) if they are independent and all are drawn from the same population. $iid$ is a model for the random sampling process.  
Consider that in some study designs, such as in election polling, great pains are made to make sure that the sample is randomly drawn from a population of interest. The idea is to expend a lot of effort on design to get robust inferences.
