### Checklist
1. Frame the problem and look at the big picture.
2. Get the data.
3. Explore the data to gain insights.
4. Prepare the data to better expose the underlying data patterns to Machine Learning algorithms.
5. Explore many different models and short-list the best ones.
6. Fine-tune your models and combine them into a great solution.
7. Present your solution.
8. Launch, monitor, and maintain your system.


### Prepare the data
* Work on copies of the data (keep the original dataset intact).
* Write functions for all data transformations you apply, for five reasons:
 - So you can easily prepare the data the next time you get a fresh dataset
 - So you can apply these transformations in future projects
 - To clean and prepare the test set
 - To clean and prepare new data instances once your solution is live
 - To make it easy to treat your preparation choices as hyperparameters
1. Data cleaning:
* Fix or remove outliers (optional).
* Fill in missing values (e.g., with zero, mean, medianâ€¦) or drop their rows (or
columns).
2. Feature selection (optional):
* Drop the attributes that provide no useful information for the task.
3. Feature engineering, where appropriate:
* Discretize continuous features.
* Decompose features (e.g., categorical, date/time, etc.).
* Add promising transformations of features (e.g., log(x), sqrt(x), x^2, etc.).
* Aggregate features into promising new features.
4. Feature scaling: standardize or normalize features.
