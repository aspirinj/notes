test_df = pd.read_csv('data/test.csv')

### Feature data
'''
**Mixed data types**  
Numerical, alphanumeric data within same feature. These are candidates for correcting goal. Ticket is a mix of numeric and alphanumeric data types. Cabin is alphanumeric.

**Errors or typos**  
This is harder to review for a large dataset, however reviewing a few samples from a smaller dataset may just tell us outright, which features may require correcting. Name feature may contain errors or typos as there are several ways used to describe a name including titles, round brackets, and quotes used for alternative or short names.

**Blank, null or empty**  
These will require correcting. Cabin > Age > Embarked features contain a number of null values in that order for the training dataset. Cabin > Age are incomplete in case of test dataset.

**Various features**  
Helping us during converting goal. Seven features are integer or floats. Six in case of test dataset. Five features are strings (object).

* Survived is a categorical feature with 0 or 1 values. Around 38% samples survived representative of the actual survival rate at 32%.  
* Few elderly passengers (<1%) within age range 65-80.  
* Nearly 30% of the passengers had siblings and/or spouse aboard.  
* Most passengers (> 75%) did not travel with parents or children.  
* Fares varied significantly with few passengers (<1%) paying as high as $512.

## Model, predict and solve
Our problem is a classification and regression problem. We want to *identify relationship between output (Survived or not) with other variables or features (Gender, Age, Port...).* 

We are also perfoming a category of machine learning which is called supervised learning as we are training our model with a given dataset. With these two criteria - Supervised Learning plus Classification and Regression, we can narrow down our choice of models to a few. These include: 

* KNN or k-Nearest Neighbors
* Support Vector Machines
* Naive Bayes classifier
* Decision Tree
* Random Forrest
* Perceptron
* Artificial neural network
* RVM or Relevance Vector Machine

# In[]
X_train = train_df.drop("Survived", axis=1)
y_train = train_df["Survived"]
X_test  = test_df.drop("PassengerId", axis=1).copy()
X_train.shape, y_train.shape, X_test.shape

### Logistic Regression
# Logistic Regression is a useful model to run early in the workflow. Logistic regression measures the relationship between the categorical dependent variable (feature) and one or more independent variables (features) by estimating probabilities using a logistic function, which is the cumulative logistic distribution. 

# In[]
logreg = LogisticRegression()
logreg.fit(X_train, y_train)
y_pred = logreg.predict(X_test)
acc_log = round(logreg.score(X_train, y_train) * 100, 2)
acc_log

'''
We can use Logistic Regression to validate our assumptions and decisions for feature creating and completing goals. This can be done by calculating the coefficient of the features in the decision function.  

Positive coefficients increase the log-odds of the response (and thus increase the probability), and negative coefficients decrease the log-odds of the response (and thus decrease the probability).

Sex is highest positivie coefficient, implying as the Sex value increases (male: 0 to female: 1), the probability of Survived=1 increases the most.

Inversely as Pclass increases, probability of Survived=1 decreases the most. This way Age*Class is a good artificial feature to model as it has second highest negative correlation with Survived. So is Title as second highest positive correlation.
'''

coeff_df = pd.DataFrame(train_df.columns.delete(0))
coeff_df.columns = ['Feature']
coeff_df["Correlation"] = pd.Series(logreg.coef_[0])
coeff_df.sort_values(by='Correlation', ascending=False)

'''
### SVM
SVM are supervised learning models with associated learning algorithms that analyze data used for classification and regression analysis. Given a set of training samples, each marked as belonging to one or the other of two categories, an SVM training algorithm builds a model that assigns new test samples to one category or the other, making it a **non-probabilistic binary** linear classifier
'''

svc = SVC()
svc.fit(X_train, y_train)
y_pred = svc.predict(X_test)
acc_svc = round(svc.score(X_train, y_train) * 100, 2)
acc_svc

'''
### KNN
In pattern recognition, the k-Nearest Neighbors algorithm (or k-NN for short) is a non-parametric method used for classification and regression. A sample is classified by a majority vote of its neighbors, with the sample being assigned to the class most common among its k nearest neighbors (k is a positive integer, typically small). If k = 1, then the object is simply assigned to the class of that single nearest neighbor. neighbors_algorithm). KNN confidence score is better than Logistics Regression but worse than SVM.
'''

knn = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors = 3)
knn.fit(X_train, y_train)
y_pred = knn.predict(X_test)
acc_knn = round(knn.score(X_train, y_train) * 100, 2)
acc_knn

'''
### Naive Bayes
Naive Bayes classifiers are a family of simple probabilistic classifiers based on applying Bayes' theorem with strong (naive) independence assumptions between the features. Naive Bayes classifiers are highly scalable, requiring a number of parameters linear in the number of variables (features) in a learning problem.
'''

gaussian = GaussianNB()
gaussian.fit(X_train, y_train)
y_pred = gaussian.predict(X_test)
acc_gaussian = round(gaussian.score(X_train, y_train) * 100, 2)
acc_gaussian

'''
### perceptron
The perceptron is an algorithm for supervised learning of binary classifiers (functions that can decide whether an input, represented by a vector of numbers, belongs to some specific class or not). It is a type of linear classifier, i.e. a classification algorithm that makes its predictions based on a linear predictor function combining a set of weights with the feature vector. The algorithm allows for online learning, in that it processes elements in the training set one at a time.  
'''

perceptron = Perceptron()
perceptron.fit(X_train, y_train)
y_pred = perceptron.predict(X_test)
acc_perceptron = round(perceptron.score(X_train, y_train) * 100, 2)
acc_perceptron

linear_svc = LinearSVC()
linear_svc.fit(X_train, y_train)
y_pred = linear_svc.predict(X_test)
acc_linear_svc = round(linear_svc.score(X_train, y_train) * 100, 2)
acc_linear_svc

sgd = SGDClassifier()
sgd.fit(X_train, y_train)
y_pred = sgd.predict(X_test)
acc_sgd = round(sgd.score(X_train, y_train) * 100, 2)
acc_sgd

'''
### Decision Tree
This model uses a decision tree as a predictive model which maps features (tree branches) to conclusions about the target value (tree leaves). Tree models where the target variable can take a finite set of values are called classification trees; in these tree structures, leaves represent class labels and branches represent conjunctions of features that lead to those class labels. Decision trees where the target variable can take continuous values (typically real numbers) are called regression trees.
'''

decision_tree = DecisionTreeClassifier()
decision_tree.fit(X_train, y_train)
y_pred = decision_tree.predict(X_test)
acc_decision_tree = round(decision_tree.score(X_train, y_train) * 100, 2)
acc_decision_tree

'''
The next model Random Forests is one of the most popular. Random forests or random decision forests are an ensemble learning method for classification, regression and other tasks, that operate by constructing a multitude of decision trees (n_estimators=100) at training time and outputting the class that is the mode of the classes (classification) or mean prediction (regression) of the individual trees. 

We decide to use this model's output (Y_pred) for creating our competition submission of results.
'''

random_forest = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100)
random_forest.fit(X_train, y_train)
y_pred = random_forest.predict(X_test)
random_forest.score(X_train, y_train)
acc_random_forest = round(random_forest.score(X_train, y_train) * 100, 2)
acc_random_forest


### Model evaluation
We can now rank our evaluation of all the models to choose the best one for our problem. While both Decision Tree and Random Forest score the same, we choose to use Random Forest as they correct for decision trees' habit of overfitting to their training set.
