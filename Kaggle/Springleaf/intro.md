Direct offers provide huge value to customers who need them, and are a fundamental part of Springleaf's marketing strategy. In order to improve their targeted efforts, Springleaf must be sure they are focusing on the customers who are likely to respond and be good candidates for their services.

Using a large set of anonymized features, Springleaf is asking you to predict which customers will respond to a direct mail offer. You are challenged to construct new meta-variables and employ feature-selection methods to approach this dauntingly wide dataset.
