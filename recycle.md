* `dnorm()`, `dgamma()`, `dpois()`, `dunif()` = return probability of a certain value from the normal, Gamma, Poisson, and uniform distributions


* if $A$ is ***independent*** of $B$, then the following are true
	* $A^c$ is independent of $B$
	* $A$ is independent of $B^c$
	* $A^c$ is independent of $B^c$
