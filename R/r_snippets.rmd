## Tidyr

### spread
* Dealing with duplicate rows:  

Since *Tidyr* is only for reshaping data, unlike *reshape2*, which aggregated and reshaped. You need to perform the aggregation before you change the data form.  
```r
mydf %>% 
  group_by(Weight, Height, Fitted, interval, limit) %>% 
  summarise(value = mean(value)) %>% 
  spread(limit, value)
```

* Dealing with missing rows:
Since *Tidyr* is only for reshaping data, we need to use `complete` to fill in missing rows. Compare `tidyr::spread` with `reshape2::dcast` below.  
```{r}
require(reshape2)
require(tidyr)
data("ChickWeight")
wideCW <- dcast(ChickWeight, Diet + Chick ~ Time, value.var = "weight")

wideCW1 <- ChickWeight %>% 
  complete(Time) %>% 
  spread(key=Time, value=weight, convert = TRUE)
```
